I start by cleaning data. Tasks during this section include:

    Drop NaN values from DataFrame
    Removing rows based on a condition
    Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)


Once I have cleaned up data, I start exploring the data. I explore 5 high level business questions related to our data:

    What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
    What city sold the most product?
    What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
    What products are most often sold together?
    What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
