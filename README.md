Project Overview

This project leverages Python, specifically the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries, to analyze and answer key business questions using 12 months of sales data from an electronics store.

The dataset contains hundreds of thousands of transactions, with details such as month, product type, price, purchase address, and more. The analysis aims to uncover sales trends, optimize business decisions, and provide actionable insights.

Data Cleaning

The analysis begins with a data preprocessing phase to ensure accuracy and consistency. Key cleaning steps include:

    Removing rows with missing (NaN) values

    Filtering out invalid rows based on specific conditions

    Converting columns to appropriate data types (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)


Business Questions Explored

After preparing the dataset, the project explores five high-level business questions:

    Best Month for Sales – Which month generated the highest revenue and how much was earned?

    Top-Performing City – Which city sold the most products?

    Optimal Advertisement Timing – At what time should advertisements be displayed to maximize purchase likelihood?

    Frequently Purchased Together – Which products are most often bought as a bundle?

    Best-Selling Product Analysis – Which product sold the most and what factors may explain its popularity?

Tools & Libraries Used

    Python

    Pandas – for data cleaning, manipulation, and aggregation

    Matplotlib – for data visualization
